# GlyCONFORMER

**GlyCONFORMERS** is a Python package that assigns labels to glycan conformers, based on their torsion angle values, in order to differentiate various 3D-structures of one single glycan. It enables the automated assignment of the conformer string that was introduced in **Grothaus et al. 2022, Exploration, Representation, and Rationalization of the Conformational Phase Space of N-Glycans, J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2022, 62, 20, 4992â€“5008** https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01049 for N-glycans.

Check the paper or tutorial for a detailed explanation of the GlyCONFORMER string generation. The workflow is not exclusivly designed for N-glycans, but can also be applyied to any other glycan type there is.
